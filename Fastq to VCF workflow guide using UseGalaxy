## Introduction

### What is a FASTQ file?

A **FASTQ** file is a standard format for storing biological sequences and their corresponding quality scores from high-throughput sequencing instruments. Each read includes:

- A sequence identifier
- A nucleotide sequence
- A separator
- A string of quality scores

### What is a VCF file?

A **VCF (Variant Call Format)** file is used to describe genetic variants (such as SNPs and indels) in a standardized format. It contains:

- Meta-information lines
- A header line
- Data lines with information like chromosome, position, reference/alternate alleles, and genotype

### What is UseGalaxy?

**Galaxy** is an open-source, web-based platform that allows users to perform bioinformatics analyses via a GUI. It supports thousands of tools and workflows for genome analysis without any programming.

### Why Use UseGalaxy?

- No coding required
- GUI-driven workflow building
- Cloud-based processing
- Easy reproducibility and sharing
- Supported by a large bioinformatics community

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- FASTQ file(s) from your sequencing experiment
- A registered [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org) account (free)
- Stable internet connection

### Recommended Tools (on Galaxy)

- **FastQC** – Quality check
- **Trimmomatic** – Read trimming
- **BWA / Bowtie2** – Read alignment
- **SAMtools** – File conversion/sorting
- **FreeBayes / GATK** – Variant calling
- **VCFtools / bcftools** – Filtering
- **SnpEff / VEP** – Annotation (optional)

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Upload FASTQ Files

1. Login to [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org)
2. Click **Upload Data**
3. Drag-and-drop your `.fastq` files or upload via URL/FTP
4. Click **Start** and wait for completion

### 2. Quality Check

- Tool: **FastQC**
- Run FastQC on the uploaded FASTQ files
- Review HTML reports for:
  - Per-base sequence quality
  - Adapter content
  - GC content

### 3. Trim Low-Quality Reads (Optional)

- Tool: **Trimmomatic** or **Cutadapt**
- Trim adapters and low-quality bases
- Use parameters based on FastQC results

### 4. Align Reads to Reference Genome

- Tool: **BWA-MEM** or **Bowtie2**
- Input: Cleaned FASTQ file and reference genome (e.g., hg38)
- Output: SAM file (Sequence Alignment Map)

### 5. Convert SAM to BAM and Sort

- Tool: **SAMtools**
  - Convert SAM to BAM
  - Sort BAM
  - Index BAM (optional but useful)

### 6. Variant Calling

- Tool: **FreeBayes** or **GATK HaplotypeCaller**
- Input: Sorted BAM + reference genome
- Output: Raw VCF file

### 7. Filter Variants

- Tool: **VCFtools** / **bcftools**
- Example filters:
  - Minimum quality (`QUAL`)
  - Minimum depth (`DP`)

### 8. (Optional) Annotate Variants

- Tool: **SnpEff**, **VEP**, or **ANNOVAR**
- Input: VCF file
- Output: Annotated VCF or table with functional impact

## Creating a Galaxy Workflow

1. Go to **Workflow > Create New Workflow**
2. Name your workflow (e.g., `FASTQ_to_VCF_Workflow`)
3. Add tools in sequence:
   - FastQC → Trimmomatic → BWA → SAMtools → FreeBayes → VCFtools
4. Connect inputs and outputs between steps
5. Save the workflow
6. Click **Run** to execute with your data

You can also share or publish your workflow for team or public use.
